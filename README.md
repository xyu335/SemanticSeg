## Private Repository For CS523 Final Project - Bandwidth Improvement In Live Multi-viewed Video Transmission

***segmentation to preserve image of target in high quality***  

using function defined in `src/detect.py` to get the instance mask from the input image  

**TO-DO**  
- improve the efficiency in transform datas between different type in python  
- improve the isolation of the function semantics, provide generic interface  
- transfer learning for views from special angle(require additional dataset for
  this senarios)
- reduce the trivial labels in the model to cut the computation cost  
- investigate into the efficiency in video segmentation improvement(research
  from illini alumini)
